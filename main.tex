\section{Motivation for Dataset Creation}

\paragraph{Why was the dataset created? (e.g., were there specific
tasks in mind, or a specific gap that needed to be filled?)}

\paragraph{What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? Are
there obvious tasks for which it should not be used?}
\paragraph{Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so,
where are the results so others can compare (e.g., links to
published papers)?}
\paragraph{Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an
associated grant, provide the grant number.}
\paragraph{Any other comments?}

\section{Dataset Composition}
\paragraph{What are the instances? (that is, examples; e.g., documents, images, people, countries) Are there multiple types
of instances? (e.g., movies, users, ratings; people, interactions between them; nodes, edges)}
\paragraph{Are relationships between instances made explicit in
the data (e.g., social network links, user/movie ratings, etc.)?}
\paragraph{How many instances of each type are there?}
\paragraph{What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data
(e.g., unprocessed text or images)? Features/attributes?}
\paragraph{Is there a label/target associated with instances? If the
instances are related to people, are subpopulations identified
(e.g., by age, gender, etc.) and what is their distribution?}
\paragraph{Is everything included or does the data rely on external
resources? (e.g., websites, tweets, datasets) If external
resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and
remain constant, over time; b) is there an official archival
version. Are there licenses, fees or rights associated with
any of the data?}
\paragraph{Are there recommended data splits or evaluation measures? (e.g., training, development, testing; accuracy/AUC)}
\paragraph{What experiments were initially run on this dataset?}
\paragraph{Have a summary of those results and, if available, provide
the link to a paper with more information here.}
\paragraph{Any other comments?}
\section{Data Collection Process}
\paragraph{How was the data collected? (e.g., hardware apparatus/sensor, manual human curation, software program, software interface/API; how were these constructs/measures/methods validated?)}
\paragraph{Who was involved in the data collection process? (e.g.,
students, crowdworkers) How were they compensated? (e.g.,
how much were crowdworkers paid?)}
\paragraph{Over what time-frame was the data collected? Does the
collection time-frame match the creation time-frame?}
\paragraph{How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text,
movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses),
or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part of
speech tags; model-based guesses for age or language)? If
the latter two, were they validated/verified and if so how?}
\paragraph{Does the dataset contain all possible instances? Or is
it, for instance, a sample (not necessarily random) from a
larger set of instances?}
\paragraph{If the dataset is a sample, then what is the population?
What was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)? Is the sample
representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)?}
\paragraph{If not, why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances)? How does this affect possible uses?}
\paragraph{Is there information missing from the dataset and why?
(this does not include intentionally dropped instances; it
might include, e.g., redacted text, withheld documents) Is
this data missing because it was unavailable?}
\paragraph{Are there any known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the data?}
\paragraph{Any other comments?}
\section{Data Preprocessing}
\paragraph{What preprocessing/cleaning was done? (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging,
SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of
missing values, etc.)}
\paragraph{Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned data? (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)}
\paragraph{Is the preprocessing software available?}
\paragraph{Does this dataset collection/processing procedure
achieve the motivation for creating the dataset stated
in the first section of this datasheet?}
\paragraph{Any other comments?}
\section{Dataset Distribution}
\paragraph{How is the dataset distributed? (e.g., website, API, etc.;
does the data have a DOI; is it archived redundantly?)}
\paragraph{When will the dataset be released/first distributed? (Is
there a canonical paper/reference for this dataset?)}
\paragraph{What license (if any) is it distributed under? Are there
any copyrights on the data?}
Are there any fees or access/export restrictions?
Any other comments?
Dataset Maintenance
Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?
How does one contact the owner/curator/manager of the
dataset (e.g. email address, or other contact info)?
Will the dataset be updated? How often and by whom?
How will updates/revisions be documented and communicated (e.g., mailing list, GitHub)? Is there an erratum?
If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be communicated?
Is there a repository to link to any/all papers/systems
that use this dataset?
If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset,
is there a mechanism for them to do so? If so, is there
a process for tracking/assessing the quality of those contributions. What is the process for communicating/distributing
these contributions to users?
Any other comments?
Legal \& Ethical Considerations
If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or
was generated by people, were they informed about the
data collection? (e.g., datasets that collect writing, photos,
interactions, transactions, etc.)
If it relates to other ethically protected subjects, have
appropriate obligations been met? (e.g., medical data
might include information collected from animals)
If it relates to people, were there any ethical review applications/reviews/approvals? (e.g. Institutional Review
Board applications)
If it relates to people, were they told what the dataset
would be used for and did they consent? What community norms exist for data collected from human communications? If consent was obtained, how? Were the people
provided with any mechanism to revoke their consent in the
future or for certain uses?
If it relates to people, could this dataset expose people
to harm or legal action? (e.g., financial social or otherwise)
What was done to mitigate or reduce the potential for harm?
If it relates to people, does it unfairly advantage or disadvantage a particular social group? In what ways? How
was this mitigated?
If it relates to people, were they provided with privacy
guarantees? If so, what guarantees and how are these
ensured?
Does the dataset comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? Does it comply with any other
standards, such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity
Act?
Does the dataset contain information that might be considered sensitive or confidential? (e.g., personally identifying information)
Does the dataset contain information that might be considered inappropriate or offensive?
Any other comments?
